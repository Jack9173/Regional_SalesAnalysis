# Regional_SalesAnalysis

This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and an interactive dashboard to uncover regional sales trends across the U.S. using five years of historical data. The goal is to identify key growth levers, optimize product/channel strategies, and guide decision-making.

🔍 Problem Statement
Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions, with little visibility into seasonality, top-performing SKUs, and channel-level profitability.

⚙️ Approach
Phase 1 – EDA: Cleaned and joined unlinked datasets (Sales, Products, Customers, Budgets, etc.), performed statistical analysis and visualized sales patterns.

Phase 2 – Dashboard: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for business users to self-serve insights and enable strategic decisions.

📊 Key Insights
Seasonality: Sales peak in May–June, drop in January.

Top Products: Products 25 & 26 dominate revenue.

Channel Insights: Wholesale = 54% sales; Export = highest margins (~38%).

Geographic Trends: California & West region lead in performance.

Customer Segmentation: Top customers generate disproportionately higher revenue.

✅ Recommendations
Launch seasonal promotions in April/January.

Focus on top-performing SKUs; drop low-margin ones.

Expand Export channel and optimize Wholesale pricing.

Replicate California’s strategy in other regions.
